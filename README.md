Project Overview

The Walmart Sales Forecasting project aims to predict future sales based on historical data. The objective is to assist in inventory management, promotional planning, and overall decision-making by leveraging machine learning techniques.

Objectives

Forecast Walmart sales using historical data.

Identify key factors influencing sales, such as promotions and seasonality.

Provide actionable insights to optimize inventory and marketing strategies.

Workflow

1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and outliers to ensure data quality.

Feature Engineering: Created temporal features (month, year, holiday indicators) and lag features (e.g., moving averages).

EDA: Explored patterns, trends, and seasonality in sales data.

2. Modeling

Implemented machine learning models including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Split data into training and testing sets and used cross-validation for model evaluation.

Conducted hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.

3. Evaluation

Evaluated models using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and MAPE.

Visualized actual vs. predicted sales trends to validate predictions.

4. Insights

Promotions and holidays significantly impact sales.

Urban stores consistently outperform rural ones in average sales.

Tools and Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost

Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Results and Recommendations

Achieved high accuracy in forecasting sales with XGBoost as the best-performing model.

Recommended optimizing inventory and planning promotions around key holidays and events.

Future Work

Integrate external factors like weather and economic data to enhance model accuracy.

Explore advanced methods like deep learning for sequential data analysis.

Develop a real-time dashboard for monitoring and forecasting sales.
